# TrackedServers-Servers
An up-to-date list of all the servers running on https://trackedservers.com/ - If you would like to add your server/network, submit a PR with it added to the list

# Things to note
* Your network will need to have at least 120 players online during peak hours
* Your network will need to primarily be an English speaking server
* You will need to have an attached website, webstore and/or Discord pertaining to your server

# Oh, uhm...
* Please run the list through a [JSON Validator](https://jsonlint.com/) before you submit
* It's not guaranteed that your network will be added
* I run TrackedServers purely for fun. If you like the project, maybe [help me offset hosting costs
